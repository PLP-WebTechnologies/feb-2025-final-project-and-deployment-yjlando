            <h1>Our Story, Our Heart</h1>
            <p>Divine Diversions was born out of a deep longing to fill a gap in today’s entertainment landscape. So many games and forms of play today either lack positive messages or celebrate values that conflict with our beliefs. We saw the need for something different—something sacred. That’s why we create board games, card games, and meaningful gifts that are not only fun and interactive, but also rooted in love, truth, kindness, and faith.</p>
            <p>Our work is guided by a desire to bring families and friends closer, to spark moments of reflection, and to cultivate joy through creativity. Every product is a result of prayerful thought, community insight, and a passion for helping others live out their faith in everyday moments. At Divine Diversions, we’re not just offering games—we’re offering tools for connection, growth, and lasting memories.</p>
