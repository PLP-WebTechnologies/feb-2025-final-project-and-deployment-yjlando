  <h1>About us</h1>

  <p>
    In a time where fast-paced screens and shallow content dominate our
    leisure, we’ve reimagined play. Our mission is to bring people together
    through fun that uplifts the spirit and reflects the heart of Christian
    values. Here, we believe that laughter, learning, and faith should never
    be separate. That’s why every game, every product, and every piece of
    content we offer is designed to inspire joy, conversation, and spiritual
    growth. Whether you're gathered around a game night table or
    exploring our gifts and merchandise, we invite you to rediscover the
    beauty of fellowship and the richness of play that matters.

  <p>
    Our work is guided by a desire to bring families and friends closer, to
    spark moments of reflection, and to cultivate joy through creativity.
    Every product is a result of prayerful thought, community insight, and
    a passion for helping others live out their faith in everyday moments.
    At Divine Diversions, we’re not just offering games, we’re offering
    tools for connection, growth, and lasting memories!
